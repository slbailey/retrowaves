Audio playback module using pygame mixer.

This module provides a simple interface for playing MP3 files using pygame's
mixer module. It includes:
- Headless environment support (WSL, servers, Raspberry Pi)
- File validation before playback
- Safety limits to prevent infinite loops
- Error handling and recovery

Example:
    ```python
    from radio.audio_player import AudioPlayer
    
    player = AudioPlayer()
    if player.play("song.mp3"):
        print("Song played successfully")
    ```
