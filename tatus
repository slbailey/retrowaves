    Add Clock A decode pacing metronome to Station subsystem
    
    - Implement Clock A (decode metronome) in PlayoutEngine to pace frame consumption at ~21.333ms per frame
    - Ensures songs play at real duration (e.g., 200-second MP3 takes 200 seconds)
    - Clock A is monotonic, wall-clock-fidelity, never observes Tower state
    - Socket writes remain non-blocking and fire immediately (no pacing on writes)
    
    Contract updates:
    - PLAYOUT_ENGINE_CONTRACT.md: Allow Clock A for decode pacing, explicitly forbid Tower-synchronized pacing
    - STATION_TOWER_PCM_BRIDGE_CONTRACT.md: Document two-clock architecture (Clock A for decode, Clock B for broadcast)
    - OUTPUT_SINK_CONTRACT.md: Clarify Clock A decode pacing vs Clock B broadcast timing
    
    Architecture updates:
    - ARCHITECTURE_STATION.md: Document Clock A decode pacing rules
    - ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md: Update diagram to show Clock A (decode metronome) and Clock B (Tower AudioPump)
    
    Invariants preserved:
    - Tower still owns ALL broadcast timing (Clock B)
    - Station never blocks Tower
    - Station never interprets Tower timing
    - Station never adjusts decode speed based on Tower behavior
    - Station-to-Tower interface remains asynchronous, non-blocking, timing-agnostic
    
    All 95 station contract tests pass.
