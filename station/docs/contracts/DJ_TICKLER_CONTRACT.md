---

## TK1 — Rules

### TK1.1 — THINK Window Execution

Ticklers **MUST** execute only during **THINK** windows.

- Ticklers are called during `on_segment_started()` callback
- Ticklers run as part of THINK phase
- Ticklers do not execute during DO phase or playback

### TK1.2 — Future Content Only

Ticklers **MUST NOT** generate assets for immediate use in the same **THINK/DO** cycle.

- Ticklers schedule content for future segments
- Ticklers do not affect current segment's intent
- Content generated by ticklers is used in future THINK/DO cycles

### TK1.3 — Non-Blocking I/O

Ticklers **MUST NOT** perform blocking I/O.

- All I/O must be non-blocking or cached
- Ticklers must complete within THINK time budget
- No network calls, file I/O, or database queries allowed

---

## Implementation Notes

- Ticklers are registered callbacks that run during THINK phase
- Ticklers may schedule content for specific future times
- Tickler output is stored and used by DJEngine in future THINK phases
- Ticklers must be lightweight and fast (no blocking operations)
- Tickler failures must not prevent THINK from completing

---

## Example Use Cases

- Schedule legal IDs at specific times (e.g., top of hour)
- Schedule promotional content at specific intervals
- Schedule special content for holidays/events
- Schedule talk segments at specific times
