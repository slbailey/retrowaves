"""
Playout engine for managing audio event playback.

This module provides the PlayoutEngine class, which manages the queue of audio events
and coordinates with the mixer for clock-driven, real-time frame delivery.

===========================================================
PLAYOUT ENGINE CONCURRENCY CONTRACT (MUST NOT BE BROKEN)
===========================================================

The PlayoutEngine runs in its own thread and coordinates the
system-wide event flow. It does NOT decode audio and MUST NEVER
block or interfere with the real-time audio thread.

ROLE SUMMARY
------------

PlayoutEngine:
    - Handles station startup sequencing.
    - Receives event_complete and song_started callbacks from Mixer.
    - Chooses when to call mixer.start_event() (deck activation).
    - Calls DJEngine ONLY when safe (never under Mixer locks).
    - Manages playlog and state machine.

CALLBACK CONTRACT
-----------------

Mixer -> PlayoutEngine:
    _event_complete_callback(event, deck)
    _song_started_callback(deck, event)

These are always delivered AFTER Mixer releases its locks.
PlayoutEngine MUST NOT call Mixer functions that reacquire locks
from inside ANY callback that Mixer fired under its own lock.

ALLOWED:
    - In _on_event_complete(): call mixer.start_event()
    - In song_started handler: call DJEngine.on_song_started()
    - Queue events
    - Playlog writes
    - State machine transitions

FORBIDDEN:
    - Blocking calls (network, disk, sleeps)
    - Holding PlayoutEngine locks and then calling into Mixer
    - Re-entering Mixer methods in a way that could cause lock recursion

EVENT MODEL (PHASE 7+)
----------------------

station_started
    → DJEngine.on_station_started()
    → preload(A)
    → start(A)
    → song_started(A)

song_started(deck)
    → DJEngine.on_song_started()
    → preload(opposite deck)

song_finished(deck)
    → playout switches to opposite deck
    → start(opposite deck)
    → song_started(opposite deck)

This file MUST obey this flow and MUST NOT introduce blocking or
callback recursion. Violations will cause the radio to freeze.
