PHASE 9 — Implement MasterClock timing engine

Goals:
- Create MasterClock service as new module /clock/master_clock.py
- Clock must emit ticks based on audio sample rate (48kHz)
- Provide callback registration: on_tick(frame_index)
- Mixer should SUBSCRIBE to MasterClock instead of pushing frames immediately
- YouTubeSink and FMSink receive frames only when clock ticks
- Add jitter smoothing (sleep drift correction)
- Ensure no component free-runs outside clock control

Clock Requirements:
- Adjustable precision (default = 48000 ticks/sec)
- Monotonic time base (time.monotonic_ns)
- Drift correction every 500ms (compare expected vs actual time)
- Optional faster timing for dev mode (simulate in real time)

Expected Behavior:
AudioDecoder feeds PCM → Mixer buffer
MasterClock releases fixed-size PCM chunk each tick window
Sinks pull equally spaced samples
RTMP no longer buffers, no starve, no runaway
FM output becomes rock-solid continuous stream
