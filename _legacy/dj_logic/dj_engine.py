DJ Engine for managing DJ intros, outros, and talk segments.

Phase 7: Implements decision logic for when to play DJ segments per song.
DJ-Driven Architecture: DJ becomes the single decision-maker.

===========================================================
DJ ENGINE CONCURRENCY CONTRACT (MUST NOT BE BROKEN)
===========================================================

The DJEngine is pure logic. It makes decisions about whether to
speak and what song/intro/outro events to schedule. It MUST be
non-blocking and must NEVER interact with real-time locks.

THREADING RULES
---------------

1. DJEngine has no locks of its own.

2. DJEngine is always invoked from PlayoutEngine callbacks,
   AFTER Mixer has released its internal locks.

3. DJEngine MUST:
       - Return quickly (milliseconds)
       - Perform only in-memory computations
       - NOT perform blocking I/O
       - NOT sleep()
       - NOT inspect mixer internals or decoders

4. DJEngine MAY:
       - Examine current song metadata
       - Choose next events (intro/song/outro)
       - Update cadence counters
       - Return a list of AudioEvent objects

5. DJEngine MUST NOT call Mixer methods directly.

Allowed flows:
    PlayoutEngine → DJEngine.on_station_started()
    PlayoutEngine → DJEngine.on_song_started(deck, event)

NOT allowed:
    Mixer → DJEngine (directly)
    DJEngine → Mixer (directly)
    DJEngine performing long operations

FUTURE-PROOF:
-------------
This contract ensures DJEngine can later be made async, external,
or AI-driven without affecting the real-time audio pipeline.
