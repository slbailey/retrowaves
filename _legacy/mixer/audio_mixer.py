"""
Audio mixer for frame-based audio processing.

This module provides the AudioMixer class, which processes PCM frames
and outputs them to registered audio sinks. Uses MasterClock for
synchronized, clock-driven frame delivery with real-time decoding.

===========================================================
AUDIO MIXER CONCURRENCY CONTRACT (MUST NOT BE BROKEN)
===========================================================

The AudioMixer runs entirely in the MasterClock thread and owns
all real-time audio behavior. It is the ONLY thread that:

    - Pulls PCM frames from decoders
    - Detects EOF events
    - Writes audio to sinks

THREADING & LOCKING RULES
-------------------------

1. Mixer internal locks:
       _decoder_lock
       _buffer_lock
       _inactive_buffer_lock

   These locks MUST NEVER be held while calling ANY callback.

2. Allowed operations while holding locks:
       - Switching decks
       - Starting FFmpeg
       - Closing decoders
       - Mutating buffers

3. Forbidden operations while holding locks:
       - Calling _event_complete_callback
       - Calling _song_started_callback
       - Calling _fm_failure_callback
       - Calling any function that may call back into Mixer

4. Callbacks MUST be invoked *after* releasing all locks.

CALLBACK CONTRACT
-----------------

Mixer emits the following callbacks:

    _event_complete_callback(event, deck)
    _song_started_callback(deck, event)
    _fm_failure_callback()

These callbacks run in the MasterClock thread after locks have been
released. They MUST execute quickly and never block or perform I/O.

SPECIAL RULES FOR start_event()
-------------------------------

start_event():
    - May acquire _decoder_lock to activate a deck.
    - MUST release _decoder_lock BEFORE firing _song_started_callback().
    - MUST NOT recursively re-enter any mixer method that requires locks.

THIS FILE MAY NOT BREAK THESE RULES.
If locks are held during callbacks, the system WILL deadlock
(especially since DJ logic calls preload_event()).
